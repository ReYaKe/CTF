License (Reverse | Warmup):
  Key has to be 16 characters long.

SM what?! (Forensics | Easy):
  TFCCTF{tool_service_ip_share}
  ip = possibly 10.23.123.11
  share = ADMIN$
  tool = RDP, WMI, something that uses ntml (have no clue how to find out)
  service = likely SMB (due to the way files were accessed but who the fuck knows)

GREETINGS (Web | Warmup):
  Possible inject in HTML through username (doesn't seem sanitized)
  <script>alert(document.a);</script> works , though unclear which info to get with this

Genetics (Crypto | Warmup):
  Likely DNA encryption
  Chunks of 4 = 1 Ascii char
  Substitution Cypher lead to a string but it was incorrect (i will get this as a tattoo real soon)
  Sub Cypher was "correct" just that we needed to map each DNA-Sequence and use the Binary to create the flag
  TFCCTF{1_w1ll_g3t_th1s_4s_4_t4tt00_V3ry_s00n}
